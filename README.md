This is a **solid and well-structured roadmap**! Everything is clearly laid out for efficient execution. It balances **backend functionality, frontend presentation, and deployment strategy** while keeping future scalability in mind. 

### üî• **Key Strengths:**
‚úÖ **Practical Timeline:** Realistic **4-5 hour** breakdown for a working prototype.  
‚úÖ **Future-Proofing:** Clear path for **blog, e-commerce, and CRM** expansion.  
‚úÖ **Multilingual from the Start:** Seamlessly integrating **English/Hebrew**.  
‚úÖ **Django Admin-Centric:** Smart use of **Django Admin** for rapid content management.
